# Microservices in Go with gRPC, API Gateway, and Authentication

This repository is part of an article series focusing on building a microservices-based application infrastructure using Go, gRPC, API Gateway, and Authentication. The series consists of two parts:

## Part 1: API Gateway

The **API Gateway** acts as the entry point for incoming HTTP requests, providing a unified interface for interacting with various microservices. It plays a crucial role in routing requests to the appropriate services.

## Part 2: Auth Service

The **Auth Service** offers essential authentication features, including user registration, login, and token generation using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). It ensures secure access to the microservices by providing reliable identity verification.

## Part 3: Product Service

The **Product Service** handles product-related functionalities such as adding products, managing stock levels, and retrieving product information. It contributes to a modular and efficient architecture by separating concerns related to product management.

## Part 4: Order Service

The **Order Service** is dedicated to the creation of orders. This microservice is designed to showcase the effective isolation of responsibilities within a microservices-based application. It specifically focuses on the "Create Order" feature.

Feel free to explore each part of this repository to gain insights into building a robust microservices infrastructure using the Go programming language and various complementary technologies.
